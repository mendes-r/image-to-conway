The idea behind this project is to transform any image into a grid for the famous ConwayÂ´s Game of Life.
After this transformation - the implementation of filters and resizing - it will be possible to play the game according to Conways' rules.

## Possible future new functionalities
This project could be turned into a web-application.

PS: this project is also a playground to learn new tools.
