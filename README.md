# Image-to-Conway
Turn an image into an initial _Conway's Game of life_ grid... and start living!

## Introduction
The idea behind this project is to transform any image into a grid for the famous ConwayÂ´s Game of Life.
After this transformation - the implementation of filters and resizing - it will be possible to play the game according to Conways' rules.

## User interface
A kind of frontend is still in debate.

## Requirements
The following requirements will give a first hint for the type of user stories and functionalities that need to be answered:

- As a user, I want to be able to upload an image.
- As a user, I want to be able to upload any type of image size.
- As a user, I want to start the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to stop the game at any moment.
- As a user, I want to be able to rewind the iterations and return to the original image.
- As a user, I want to be able to save the image that results of any given number of iterations.

## Possible future new functionalities
This project could be turned into a web-application.

PS: this project is also a playground to learn new tools.
